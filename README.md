# Android Demo Include Layout

The goal here is to have a reusable component that displays an image file at left and a string at right. The image file and string need to be configurable from the parent layout.

The code here is about as simple as you can get and shows how to do it.

Make sure you've used the `<layout>` tag in `activity_main.xml` and `reuse_me.xml`.


The include file is called with `mySrc` and `xyzzy` set from `string` and `drawable` resources. This is done twice within the `activity_main.xml`.


```
    <include
        android:id="@+id/include_2"
        layout="@layout/reuse_me"
...
        app:xyzzy='@{@string/hello2}'
        app:mySrc='@{@drawable/baseline_warning_amber_24}'
        />
```

Make sure to do this in `MainActivity`:

```
ActivityMainBindingImpl binding = DataBindingUtil.setContentView(this, R.layout.activity_main);
```

`ActivityMainBindingImpl` will be generated by the IDE (Android Studio). This is true when the project was created (Jun 2023). The IDE is Android Studio Electric Eel | 2022.1.1 Patch 1.

Result is shown below - a reusable component with text and image that were passed in via an include file.
